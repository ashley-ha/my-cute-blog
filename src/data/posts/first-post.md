I'm ashley & welcome to my blog

A bit about me: 
- i live in korea currently (& speak korean too 안녕~)
- i'm building a startup. or, trying to anyways
- i love working out, video games, reading, learning, spending time with family, traveling
- uc berkeley alumni; I studied data science
- flight attendant in a previous life
- i love, love, love people. making connections with others is one of my biggest joys in life

I've been wanting to make a personal website for a while now

Mostly to share my current reading lists, some original writings about life learnings, and just thoughts that come to my mind at 1am

I hope you enjoy taking a small peek into my life & that you learn at least one new thing from each blog post

It's a beautiful thing to be human. To read, to learn, to build & to connect with each other

I'll end this introduction with an open invitation to connect with me online — or email me with your thoughts

Talk soon~ 

Ashley
