I'm ashley & welcome to my cute blog

I've been wanting to make a personal website for a while now. 

Mostly to share my current reading lists, some original writings about life learnings, and just thoughts that come to mind

I hope you enjoy taking a small peek into my life & that you learn at least one new thing from each blog post

It's a beautiful thing to be human. To read, to learn, to build & to connect with each other

I'll end this introduction with an open invitation to connect with me online â€” or email me with your thoughts

Talk soon~ 

Ashley
